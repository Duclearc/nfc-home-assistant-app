# Welcome to nfc-home-assistant ðŸ‘‹

## Goal

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created by [Dan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-pina-794a801a9/) and [Haydn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haydn-morris/) as a fun side-project for Haydn's house. The goal was to allow guests access to some devices in his home by scanning an NFC tag with this app, which grants them access to pre-selected devices in his [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) network.
